## Tips

* __Tip__ If you're inclined to learning from print, I highly recommend finding a used college-level textbook (the thicker the better) as they tend to discuss the basics in more depths than an ebook or blog post
* MEMORIZE IT BY HEART - it's not intuitive
* This stuff is easy but it's fairly boring to learn. Think of it like learning multiplication scales. You will get to do more interesting algorithms later
* You will rarely encounter this stuff in your everyday job, so it's all the more important to find special ways to memorize this. Dip it in candy / chocolate / any non illegal substance
