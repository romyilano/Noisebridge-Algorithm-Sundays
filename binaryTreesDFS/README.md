# Learning Notes

The biggest trip-up for people is that while this is fairly easy, it
tends to be boring to learn and it is not a data structure you use
in everyday life.

I encourage you to find any way possible to make this more interesting 
than it is upon first glance, whether it be through pictures, candy or
non illegal substances

Once you memorize this stuff, then you can move on to more interesting
problems like graph algorithms, more sophisticated binary trees, etc. and 
breadth-first searches. 

Think of this as downing some medicine before being able to do the
fun stuff.
